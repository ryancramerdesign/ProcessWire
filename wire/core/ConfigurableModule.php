 * 
 * About the ConfigurableModule interface
 * ======================================
 * ConfigurableModule is an interface that indicates the module is configurable by providing
 * __get() and __set() methods for getting and setting config values. Modules implementing 
 * this interface are assumed to also implement the 'Module' interface.
 * 
 * The module must also provide one (1) of the following:
 *
 * 1. A getModuleConfigInputfields([$data]) method (static or non-static); OR
 * 2. A separate ModuleName.config.php file that just populates $config array; OR
 * 3. A separate ModuleNameConfig.php file that contains a ModuleConfig class.
 *
 * For more details about the above options, see the commented methods within
 * the interface.
 *
 * When you use this as an interface, you MUST also use 'Module' as an interface,
 * i.e. "class Something implements Module, ConfigurableModule"
 *
 * Hint: Make your ConfigurableModule classes inherit from WireData, which already has
 * the get/set required methods.
 *
 * You may optionally specify a handler method for configuration data: setConfigData().
 * If present, it will be used. See commented function reference in the interface below.
 * 
 *

interface ConfigurableModule {

	/**********************************************************************************
	 * getModuleConfigInputfields method (static or non-static)
	 *
	 * Return an InputfieldWrapper of Inputfields used to configure the class. This may
	 * be specified either as a static method or a non-static method.
	 *
	 * Benefits of static version
	 * ===========================
	 * 1. The module does not need to be instantiated in order to configure it, which
	 *    means that unnecessary hooks won't get attached and unnecessary assets won't
	 *    be triggered to load.
	 * 2. It is supported by all versions of ProcessWire.
	 *
	 * Drawbacks of static version
	 * ===========================
	 * 1. You cannot pull config values directly from the module since it isn't
	 *    instantiated, and thus you must use the provided $data array. This $data array
	 *    only contains values if the module has been configured before.
	 * 2. You can't access $this or anything you'd typically pull from it, like API vars
	 *    or translation methods.
	 *
	 * Benefits of non-static version
	 * ==============================
	 * 1. You are working with the module in the same context that it is when running,
	 *    thus you can pull config values and API vars directly from $this->something.
	 * 2. It can be extended in descending classes.
	 * 3. The $data argument can be omitted, as you don't need it since all config
	 *    properties can be accessed directly from $this->[any property]. 
	 * 4. You can specify an optional $inputfields argument in your function definition
	 *    and if present, ProcessWire will prepare an InputfieldWrapper for you, saving
	 *    a step. When present, you can optionally omit the return statement at the 
	 *    bottom of the method as well. 
	 *
	 * Drawbacks of non-static version
	 * ================================
	 * 1. It is supported only in ProcessWire versions 2.5.27 or newer.
	 * 2. The module must be instantiated in order to configure it, so it may trigger
	 *    load of any used assets or attachment of any hooks unnecessarily.
	 *
	 * @param array $data Array of config values indexed by field name (static version only)
	 * 	Note that this array will be empty if the module has not been configured before.
	 * @return InputfieldWrapper
	 *
	 *  
	 * // static version
	 * public static function getModuleConfigInputfields(array $data); 
	 * 
	 * // non-static version
	 * public function getModuleConfigInputfields(); 
	 *  
	 * // non-static version with optional $data array, if you want it for some reason
	 * public function getModuleConfigInputfields(array $data); 
	 *  
	 * // non-static version with optional InputfieldWrapper as a convenience
	 * // note that the "return" statement may be omitted when using the $inputfields param.
	 * public function getModuleConfigInputfields($inputfields); 
	 *

	/*********************************************************************************
	 * Return an array defining Inputfields (static or non-static)
	 * 
	 * You should use either getModuleConfigArray() or getModuleConfigInputfields(),
	 * do not use both, as ProcessWire will only recognize one or the other. Likewise,
	 * you should either use the static version of non-static version, not both. 
	 *
	 * See notes for getModuleConfigInputfields() above for benefits and drawbacks
	 * of static vs. non-static versions. The primary difference between this method
	 * and that method is that this one returns an array. The format of the array should
	 * be as shown in InputfieldWrapper::importArray (see InputfieldWrapper.php).
	 * 
	 * Whether static or non-static, your 'value' attributes in the array need only 
	 * represent the default values. ProcessWire will populate the actual values 
	 * to the resulting Inputfields after the method has been called. This is a benefit
	 * over the getModuleConfigInputfields() methods.
