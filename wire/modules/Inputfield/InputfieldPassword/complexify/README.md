Complexify
====================

Websites have a responsibility to accurately inform users of password strength, both to better secure data, and to educate about users of what constitutes a good password.

Complexify aims to provide a good measure of password complexity for websites to use both for giving hints to users in the form of strength bars, and for *casually* enforcing a minimum complexity for security reasons.

This plugin only provides client-side validation, and should be combined with some server-side sanity checking. If you want a full-blown Complexify implementation for the server, check out the list of ports.
