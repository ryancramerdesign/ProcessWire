/**
 * CKEditor field-specific (body) custom config file for ProcessWire
 *
 * Use this file to specify additional config options to a field named "body".
 * This is here just for example purposes. If you wanted to create a config
 * specific to some other field, like "sidebar", you would create another file
 * exactly like this named: config-sidebar.js
 *
 * If you wanted to use the same config.js for all of your CKEditor fields,
 * you would remove this file and just use the config.js file instead. Meaning,
 * this file completely overrides config.js if the field being edited is named
 * "body". The regular config.js file is not loaded when this one is loaded.
